disable shit in your bios.
bluetooth. wireless. windowsme, intel management. use hardwired when you can. purchase computers from foreign companies. if you are having issues with domestic agencies it makes more
sense to buy foreign.

i can't verify if companies like system 76, or framework are any better.
same thing with these libreboot systems. i have no experience with them.
