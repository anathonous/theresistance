apple has fallen

they're like a fucking defense contractor. for a corrupt government who doesn't respect your security, privacy or well being.

all that shit about them not being able to read your messages is bullshit. it's all a song and dance, you'd have to be foolish to think otherwise. 
if you live in some african country maybe but if your issue is domestic intelligence agencies trampling on you.

just stay clear of apple.
