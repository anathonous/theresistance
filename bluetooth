anything with a bluetooth devices has hardware level sockets, they can pretty much pipe whatever they want through it. bluetooth is sketchy, 
phones, laptops, tablets, headphones. bluetooth is the backdoor. thats how they get you without a network connection.
even then, if your phone is connected to a cell tower you don't even need a sim they can route over packet networks.
