buy some of the older lte mobile hotspots and mobile sticks.
they are cheap, do 150mb per second.
sierra wireless, hauwiei etc. cheap.

pick up some simcards for canadian carriers. 
lucky, chatr, koodo, etc.
most have pretty good data plans for reasonably cheap.

keep your personal phone and hotspot seperate.
